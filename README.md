## About
These materials were written and tested in [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) 3.6, including the [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/user/index.html), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/index.html), and [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/index.html) packages. There are many more packages available for doing data analysis in Python, but these three include everything a practicing physicist needs to get started.
