# Data analysis with Python

This repository contains instructional materials for learning data analysis for applications in the physical sciences. They are in the form of [Jupyter](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) notebooks using the [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) programming language. A suitable textbook to accompany these materials is [*Measurements and their Uncertainties*](https://www.oupcanada.com/catalog/9780199566334.html), by Hughes and Hase.

## How to use these materials
You should be able to read, run, and modify the notebooks in this repository following any one of the following methods. 

### Syzygy
[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open_in-SyZyGy-orange)](https://sfu.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjsdodge%2Fdata-analysis-python.git&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fdata-analysis-python.git%2F&branch=main)

If you are an SFU student, you will probably want to use Syzygy, which you can sign in to with your SFU Computing Account. [Syzygy](https://sfu.syzygy.ca/) is a cloud-based [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) server hosted by the [Digital Research Alliance of Canada](https://alliancecan.ca/en). Select the icon above to pull the notebooks into your SFU Syzygy account. Syzygy will prompt you to log in if you are not already logged in. You can also use this link to upload changes to the notebooks that occur during the course. You may also upload files to Syzygy from a local desktop computer.

Within the Syzygy interface, open the `.ipynb` notebook files in the `notebooks` directory to read the documentation and run the code.

### Anaconda
If you prefer to work with the notebooks locally on your personal computer, install the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download), download the notebooks from [GitHub](https://github.com/jsdodge/data-analysis-python), and open the notebooks with the [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) application in [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/navigator/overview/#nav-home-page-overview).

### Google Colab
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jsdodge/data-analysis-python/blob/main/)

Select the icon above to open the notebooks in the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) service.


### Binder
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jsdodge/data-analysis-python/main)

Select the icon above to run the notebooks in the free, open-source [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) service. Note that it can take a while to initialize this environment.

## About
These materials have been tested in Python 3.10, including the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html) (1.23), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/index.html) (3.7), and [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/index.html) (1.10) packages. There are many more packages available for doing data analysis in Python, but these three include everything a practicing physicist needs to get started.
