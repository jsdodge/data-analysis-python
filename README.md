# data-analysis-python

This repository contains instructional materials for learning data analysis for applications in the physical sciences. They are in the form of [Jupyter](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) notebooks using the [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) programming language. A suitable textbook to accompany these materials is [*Measurements and their Uncertainties*](http://www.oupcanada.com/catalog/9780199566334.html), by Hughes and Hase.

These materials are a work in progress and I welcome feedback at <jsdodge@sfu.ca>.

## How to use these materials
To read, run, and modify the notebooks in this repository, you can try any of the following:

* If you are an SFU student, follow [this link](
https://sfu.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://gitlab.rcg.sfu.ca/jsdodge/data-analysis-python.git&branch=master
) to copy the entire repository into [Syzygy](https://sfu.syzygy.ca/), a cloud-based Jupyter notebook server hosted by [Compute Canada](https://www.computecanada.ca/). Within the Syzygy interface, open the `.ipynb` notebook files in the `notebooks` directory to read the documentation and run the code.
* Copy the repository to your personal computer, install the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download), and open the notebooks with the Jupyter notebook service in Anaconda Navigator.
* Copy the notebooks into the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) service.

## About
These materials were written and tested in Python 3.7, including the [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/index.html) (1.17), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/index.html) (3.1), and [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/index.html) (1.3) packages. There are many more packages available for doing data analysis in Python, but these three include everything a practicing physicist needs to get started.
