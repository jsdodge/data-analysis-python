# Data analysis with Python

This repository contains instructional materials for learning data analysis for applications in the physical sciences. They are in the form of [Jupyter](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) notebooks using the [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) programming language. A suitable textbook to accompany these materials is [*Measurements and their Uncertainties*](http://www.oupcanada.com/catalog/9780199566334.html), by Hughes and Hase.

These materials are a work in progress and I welcome feedback at [jsdodge@sfu.ca](mailto:jsdodge@sfu.ca).

## How to use these materials
You should be able to read, run, and modify the notebooks in this repository following any one of the following methods. 

If you are an SFU student, you will probably want to use Syzygy, which you can sign in to with your SFU Computing Account. [Syzygy](https://sfu.syzygy.ca/) is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook server hosted by the [Digital Research Alliance of Canada](https://alliancecan.ca/en). To upload the notebooks into your SFU Syzygy account: 
* Use this [link](https://sfu.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/jsdodge/data-analysis-python.git&branch=main), which should upload the contents of all the folders in the PHYS 233 repository directly to your syzygy account. Syzygy will prompt you to log in if you are not already logged in. You can also use this link to upload changes to the notebooks that occur during the course.
* Or download the folder as a .zip file, unpack it into a folder, and upload the files to sfu.syzygy.ca.

Within the Syzygy interface, open the `.ipynb` notebook files in the `notebooks` directory to read the documentation and run the code.

Or you can copy the repository to your personal computer, install the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download), and open the notebooks with the Jupyter notebook service in Anaconda Navigator.

Or you can copy the notebooks into the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) service.


## About
These materials were written and tested in Python 3.7, including the [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/index.html) (1.17), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/index.html) (3.1), and [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/index.html) (1.3) packages. There are many more packages available for doing data analysis in Python, but these three include everything a practicing physicist needs to get started.
