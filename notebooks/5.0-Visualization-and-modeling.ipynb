Normally the font sizes for the axis labels, tick labels, and legend should be the same or less than that of the report text, which we assume here is 12 [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_%28typography%29) (1 point = 1/72 inch). We also explicitly set the data marker size to 5 points and the model line width to 1.25 points—normally, the default marker size is 6 points and the default line width is 1.5 points. Finally, we set [`zorder=3`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/misc/zorder_demo.html) in the first call to `plot` to put the markers on top of the model line (alternatively, we could also just change the order of the `plot` commands)."
