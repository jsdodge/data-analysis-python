Most modules contains questions related to the required textbook for this course, Measurements and their Uncertainties, by Hughes and Hase. Sections in the worksheet are numbered to be consistent with the text. Please read the corresponding section of the book before beginning the associated section of the worksheet and then do the questions, using the book as a reference as you work. \n",

    "## Random number generation (RNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "RNGs are wonderful tools for learning about statistics, simulating experiments, and even doing certain types of theoretical calculations. You might wonder how a computer, a completely deterministic machine, can generate random numbers. The short answer is that it does not; the functions use algorithms that are cleverly designed to produce numbers that satisfy most statistical requirements associated with randomness, but actually follow a well-defined sequence. If this sounds strange, you are not alone: the great 20th century mathematician John von Neumann wrote, \"Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.\" [J. von Neumann, NBS Applied Mathematics Series, (1951).](https://dornsifecms.usc.edu/assets/sites/520/docs/VonNeumann-ams12p36-38.pdf) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, the numbers produced by rand and randn are called pseudorandom numbers to distinguish them from their purer counterparts. A brief review of the algorithm used for rand is available in the short article [\"Random Thoughts\"](toBeAdded) by Cleve Moler; a more comprehensive and mathematical review of the subject is available in Don Knuth's [The Art of Computer Programming, volume 2: Seminumerical Algorithms](toBeAdded) , among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use Python's random number generation capabilities to simulate experimental errors. In order to use random number in Python we need to use a library called [\"random\"](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html). This library contains several functions that deal with random number generation. One of these function is random.random(). This function returns random numbers that are uniformly distributed over \\[0.0, 1.0).\n",
