    "In both the [`std`](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.std.html) and the [`var`](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.var.html) functions it is important to set the option `ddof=1` for consistency with *MU* Eq. (2.3). The documentation for both functions describes this option as follows.\n",

    "Both options are shown below, and you will see that the difference is not that large. Since we will normally only need to know the standard deviation to one significant figure anyway, the error we get by forgetting to set `ddof=1` is usually unimportant. The two options are quite different conceptually, however, so you should get in the habit of using `ddof=1` in this context.\n",

    "And just to be sure that `mean` and `std` are doing what we think they are doing, we use the NumPy [`sum`](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html) function and the built-in Python [`len`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len) function to evaluate them explicitly.

With a coin flip we have only two possible outcomes, *Heads* or *Tails*, so when we specify the parent distribution we can just assign a discrete probability to each one. And while this is also true of the numbers returned by `rand`, since the number of floating-point numbers between 0.0 and 1.0 is large but [ultimately finite](https://lemire.me/blog/2017/02/28/how-many-floating-point-numbers-are-in-the-interval-01/), it is more convenient to consider them as elements of the continuous, *infinite* set $\\{x|x\\in\\mathbb{R}, 0\\le x \\le 1\\}$, where $\\mathbb{R}$ represents the set of real numbers. In this case, the probability of drawing any *specific* number between 0 and 1 is infinitesimal, so the approach that we used with the coin flip is unsuitable.

    "You might notice that this histogram is a little asymmetrical. This is because the *true* distribution for $\\alpha$ in this case is not really Gaussian, just approximately so. This approximation gets better as the number of measurements in the sample increases—and it gets worse when it decreases. You can reexecute the cell with `N_meas = 2` to see the worst-case scenario (the corrected standard deviation is infinite for `Nmeas = 1`). This is worth keeping in mind when you report the mean and standard error of a set of measurements. If you are going to rely on the standard error in other statistical computations, such as a curve fit, it is best to have a sample of at least five measurements."

    "### A word on words\n",
    "By now you have seen that the world of statistics is a bit of a linguistic minefield. We have the standard deviation of the *population* $\\sigma$; the corrected and  uncorrected standard deviations of the *sample* $\\sigma_{N-1}$ and $\\sigma_{N}$, respectively, sometimes distinguished from $\\sigma$ by using the notation $s$; and the standard deviation of the *mean*, $\\alpha$. We have the mean of the sample $\\bar{x}$ and the population mean $\\mu$. And the *true* standard deviation of the mean, $\\sigma/\\sqrt{N}$,  when $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are *known,* and the *estimated* standard deviation of the mean, $\\sigma_{N-1}/\\sqrt{N}$, when they are *unknown*. Browse through the internet and you will find many lost souls who are struggling to understand these seemingly mystical distinctions, along with equally many overconfident pedants who prescribe their personal usage preferences as gospel (see also: split infinitives).\n",
    "\n",
    "The root cause of most of this confusion is related to one of the basic activities of statistics, known as *statistical inference,*  which is to make *general* statements about the world from a *particular* set of observations of it. To do this, we must compare the quantities that we actually measure (the sample) with our idealized expectations of those quantities (over the population), and it can be easy to confuse them because we like to think that they ultimately refer to same thing (reality). We are also prone to use the same words to refer to them, just as I might refer to my language in this sentence as an example of the English language. In statistical usage, the words *mean,* *standard deviation,* and *variance* may be applied to *any* set of numerical quantities, real or imagined, so their meaning will vary with the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statisticians are keenly aware of the opportunities for confusion here, and they have developed a variety of notational devices to help communicate clearly. A particularly helpful notation in this context is to use the caret (\"^\", also called a \"hat\") to distinguish a fixed, typically unknown quantity $p$ from its *statistical estimate* $\\hat{p}$, which is known but will vary with the data that contribute to the estimate. In this notation, the population mean is $\\mu$ and the sample mean is $\\hat{\\mu} = \\bar{x}$. We are also free to construct other functions to estimate $\\mu$—not just the arithmetic average $\\bar{x}$—and refer to it as $\\hat{\\mu}$; examples include the mode, the median, the geometric mean, and the trimmed mean, which can all be useful in the right circumstances. Similarly, $\\hat{\\sigma}$ is an estimate of the standard deviation of the population $\\sigma$, which we would typically specify as either $\\sigma_{N-1}$ or $\\sigma_N$. We also have $\\alpha = \\sigma/\\sqrt{N}$ and $\\hat{\\alpha} = \\hat{\\sigma}/\\sqrt{N}$. We will use this notation occasionally in these notebooks to improve clarity."

    "### How to interpret the mean ± the standard error\n",
    "The following code cell plots the mean of 100 of our simulated experiments with vertical error bars that extend over $\\bar{x}\\pm\\hat{\\alpha}$, and the population mean $\\mu$ is shown with a red horizontal line. Several things are worth noticing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Many (25 of the first 100) of the sample means lie more than one standard error from the true mean.\n",
    "2. The standard errors fluctuate.\n",
    "3. Whether a sample mean lies within one standard error of the true mean depends on *both* the distance of the sample mean to the true mean *and* the size of the standard error.\n",
    "4. If you set `N_meas = 3` and repeat the cell computation, you should see a greater number of sample means that lie more than one standard error from the true mean, and that the standard error fluctuations are larger.  Set `N_meas = 2` and both effects become even more pronounced.\n",
    "\n",
    "These observations provide some guidance toward correctly interpreting $\\bar{x}\\pm\\hat{\\alpha}$. Most importantly, it is a statement about *a particular set of measurements, not the quantity that is being measured.* The relationship between the two involves assumptions that can change as you continue the measurement process—for example, you might discover a systematic error in the measurement that causes you to change how you define $\\bar{x}$ in the first place. More typically, $\\bar{x}$ and $\\hat{\\alpha}$ will fluctuate as you acquire new data, so our interpretation of them should reflect this variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The expression $\\bar{x}\\pm\\hat{\\alpha}$ is an *estimate* of the mean and width of the distribution that we *would expect to observe* if we were to perform repeated identical measurements. This distribution is usually understood to be $P_\\text{DF}(\\bar{x}) = \\mathcal{N}(\\bar{x};\\mu,\\alpha^2)$, where $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ are the true mean and standard error, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect the range $[\\bar{x}-\\hat{\\alpha},\\bar{x}+\\hat{\\alpha}]$ to include the true value most of the time, assuming that the measurements are limited by statistical uncertainty with normally-distributed errors. If $N\\gtrsim  6$, the range will include the true value in about 2/3 of the measurements, as expected for a normal distribution with a standard deviation given by the standard error. For $N<6$, however, the fluctuations in $\\sigma_{N-1}$ become large enough to introduce significant deviations from these expectations. (The true distribution is not quite normal, but a Student *t*-distribution, which is discussed in *MU* Sec. 8.8.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation also reveals the flaws in some common misconceptions about the standard error.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The probability that the true value either lies within a *given* $\\bar{x}\\pm\\hat{\\alpha}$ range is either 0% or 100%, and your measurement doesn't tell you which it is. It is *incorrect* to say that $\\bar{x}\\pm\\hat{\\alpha}$ provides a range that has a 68% (or other intermediate) probability of containing the true value.\n",
    "2. A measurement that lies more than one or even two standard errors from the expected value is *not necessarily wrong,* as it may arise from a statistical fluctuation.\n",
    "3. The estimated standard error fluctuates, especially if $N$ is small. A change in $\\hat{\\alpha}$ of a factor of two is not necessarily an indication that something changed in the experiment.\n",
    "4. Although the mean ± the standard error is usually understood to represent a normal distribution, it really only approaches one when $N\\gtrsim 6$. For $N<6$, significant deviations from normality become important."
