    "Ideally you will get to the end of this whole process and find that the model fits the data well, and you can report your results with confidence. If time allows, you might even go back and take more data to improve the precision of your parameter estimates. But what happens if your $\\chi^2$ statistic is too big or too small, or if the normalized residuals do not appear random? If that's the case, you have a few options:\n",

    "* Look for defects in your experimental procedure, including the procedure you used to prepare the raw data for analysis (ie, incorrect unit conversion).\n",
    "* Consider a different model. This may include changes that are based on physical reasoning, such as eliminating approximations to make it more realistic, or purely empirical, such as adding a constant background, or an extra term in a polynomial fit. The residuals should provide guidance on how to change the functional relationship to improve agreement. Just don't overdo it: if you find yourself needing to add many arbitrary fit parameters to achieve a good fit, that is usually a sign that you need to consider a different approach.\n",
    "* Consider restricting your fit to a narrower range of measurements (i.e., focus on limiting values of $x$ and/or $y$, or on the heights, widths and locations of peaks instead of their detailed shape).\n",
    "* Consider rescaling the uncertainties, as described in Sec. 8.9 of Hughes and Hase (though note their \"health warning\" in Footnote 9).\n",
