    "### Outliers, or: Chauvenet is dead. Let his criterion die with him.\n",
    "When we observe something that we expect to happen by chance less than once in a million, it is natural to feel justified in believing that it didn't happen by chance. But we humans are notoriously bad at predicting the true likelihood of relatively unlikely events, which clouds our ability to distinguish signal from noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have the tools to confirm the assertion in *MU* Sec. 3.3.2, that \"the fractional area under a Gaussian curve beyond $3\\sigma$ or $5\\sigma$ is only 0.3% or $6\\times 10^{-5}\\%$, respectively.\" These are small probabilities, and over time they have been used in the particle physics community to establish standards for \"evidence\" and \"discovery\" of a new particle, such as the Higgs boson (though the associated probabilities are actually 0.13% and $3\\times 10^{-5}\\%$, because they refer to the probabilities of being, respectively, $3\\sigma$ or $5\\sigma$ *above* the background, not below it).\n",
    "\n",
    "But our expectation that measurements should follow a normal distribution is often wrong. In everyday experiments, most measurements are *not* normally distributed. One [study](#Bailey2017) of the published literature found that $5\\sigma$ events occurred up to *100,000 times more frequently than expected* if the measurements were normally distributed. This large discrepancy may be traced back to differences between the \"tails\" of different distributions, which refers to the portions of the distribution that lie far from the mean. The exponential form of the normal distribution causes it to approach zero much more rapidly than real measurements usually do."
