    "We saw in the [2.0 Basic statistics](2.0-Basic-statistics.ipynb#How-to-interpret-the-mean-±-the-standard-error) notebook that the expression $\\bar{x}\\pm\\hat{\\alpha}$ represents an estimate of the statistical distribution that we expect for repeated identical measurements, typically $P_\\text{DF}(\\bar{x}) = \\mathcal{N}(\\bar{x};\\mu,\\alpha^2)$. The function $\\bar{y} = f(\\bar{x})$ now represents a *different* distribution, $P'_{DF}(\\bar{y})$, that we can relate to $P_\\text{DF}(\\bar{x})$. Usually we can use the linear approximation $f(\\bar{x}+\\Delta)\\approx f(\\bar{x}) + f'(\\bar{x})\\Delta$ discussed in *MU* Sec. 4.1, but it is important to be aware that this approximation is not always valid. The code cell below shows the distribution for $Z = 10^A$ with $A = 2.3\\pm 0.1$, as discussed in *MU* Sec. 4.1.4. The first plot shows that the funtion $Z(A)$ has clear positive curvature; this causes the distribution for $Z(A)$ to become skewed toward higher values. Nonetheless, the procedure described in *MU* Sec. 4.1 yields an accurate estimate of its mean and standard deviation."
