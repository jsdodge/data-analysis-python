    "\n",
    "Random number generators (RNGs) are widely used in statistics, experimental simulation, and theoretical calculations. We'll be using the random number generator routines in NumPy to simulate experimental data and to develop an intuition for statistical analysis. You might wonder how a computer, a completely deterministic machine, can generate random numbers. The short answer is that it does not; the functions described below use algorithms that are cleverly designed to produce numbers that satisfy most statistical requirements associated with randomness, but actually follow a well-defined sequence. If this sounds strange, you are not alone: the great 20th century mathematician John von Neumann [wrote](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435030295547&view=image&seq=48), \"Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Von Neumann was in a position to know: he is credited with developing the first algorithm to generate random numbers with the [first general-purpose computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC), although there is some evidence that his [middle-square method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-square_method) first appeared in the 13th century. This method is obsolete now, but it illustrates some important principles of modern random number generators, so we will describe it here for the case of generating a random sequence of integers from 0 to 9999 (the original application involved 10-digit integers, from 0 to 9999999999).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by choosing a number from 0 to 9999, which we call the *seed*. This will be the first number, $n_1$, in our sequence.\n",
    "2. For all subsequent numbers $\\{n_2,\\ldots,n_i,n_{i+1},\\ldots\\}$, the element $n_{i+1}$ is given by *the middle four digits* of $n_i^2$ after prepending it with as many zeros as necessary to form an eight-digit number; for example, if $n_1 = 1862$, then $n_1^2 = 3467044$, which we write as 03<u>4670</u>44, so $n_2 = 4670$. This is an example of a mathematical [recurrence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation), in which element $n_{i+1}$ of the sequence is defined by the preceding term, $n_{i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "All modern random number generators have this basic structure: a nonrandom *seed* that initiates the sequence, and a *recurrence relation* that generates all subsequent elements in the sequence, which should be indistinguishable from a random sequence if the algorithm is any good. Despite this appearance of randomness, however, the sequence is perfectly reproducible once the seed has been specified, so often they are called *pseudorandom* numbers."

    "* Use `arange` from NumPy to create an array of equally distributed values.\n",
    "* Construct a basic `for` loop.\n",
    "* Use  `default_rng` from NumPy to create a random number generator object and use the `random` method to produce uniformly distributed random numbers on the interval \\[0.0, 1.0).\n",
    "* Use `plot` and `hist` from Matplotlib to produce basic *x*-*y* plots and histograms.\n",
    "* Get help on Python functions.\n",
