    "* The residuals should look random and consistent with a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "    * A clear pattern in the residuals is a sign of systematic error that ideally should be fixed in the experiment, but could be accommodated by revising the model function.\n",
    "    * Outliers often indicate unreliability in your procedure; try to understand how it happened and take another data set if time allows\n",
    "* The normalized residuals should have a variance close to one.\n",
    "    * A large discrepancy between the variance of the residuals and your estimated measurement variance is worth revisiting, since it often indicates an error in the estimate of $\\alpha$. If you can not identify the source of the discrepancy, you might consider scaling the measurement uncertainy.\n",

    "\n",
    "So far, we have been using the [`pyplot`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html) interface to Matplotlib, which is designed for making simple plots interactively. For more complex plots, it is preferable to use the [`explicit \"Axes\" interface`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/api_interfaces.html#the-explicit-axes-interface), also known as the object-oriented interface, which we introduce here.\n",
    "\n",
    "After computing the model curve and the fit residuals in the cell below, we use the [`subplots`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplots.html) function to create two plot axes within a single figure. This function returns two outputs, which we assign to the variables `fig` and `axs`. The `fig` variable represents an instance of the [`Figure`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/figure_api.html#matplotlib.figure.Figure) object, which contains all the other figure elements. The `axs` variable is a NumPy array that contains instances of the [`Axes`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.html) object, each associated with a different plot within the figure. The first two positional arguments of `subplots` specify the number of rows and columns in the array, so `plt.subplots(2, 1)` returns a figure with 2 rows and 1 column of plot axes, with the top plot assigned to `axs[0]` and the bottom plot assigned to `axs[1]`. Setting `sharex=True` causes the two subplots to share a common x-axis and shows the x tick labels only on the bottom subplot. Setting `height_ratios=[3, 1]` makes the top subplot three times as high as the bottom one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can direct plotting separate commands to each of the two `Axes` instances. The expression `axs[0].errorbar(...)`, for example, creates an `errorbar` plot in the top `Axes`. The next expression, `axs[0].plot(...)`, shows the fitted model curve. The syntax for setting the axis ranges and formatting the axis labels is a little different from that of `pyplot`: instead of `plt.ylim(...)`, for example, we use `axs[0].set_ylim(...)`. Once we have completed the top panel, we use similar commands, preceded by `axs[1]`, to format the bottom panel. We introduce the [`axhline`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.axhline.html) to create a horizontal dotted black line at $y = 0$, which is the baseline for the fit residuals. We also include a newline character, `\\n`, in y-axis label of the bottom plot to reduce its width. Once we are finished, we call `plt.show()` to display the plot, just as we do with the `pyplot` interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on how to use the object-oriented interface, see the Matplotlib tutorials on [Working with multiple figures and axes](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html#working-with-multiple-figures-and-axes) and  [High-level methods for making grids](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/intermediate/arranging_axes.html#high-level-methods-for-making-grids)."
